Messing around with making a text-based Pokémon game.

The game works best on [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) (or [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq)) and doesn't require any external programs except for the [latest lua version](https://www.lua.org/download.html) (5.3 at the time of writing)
